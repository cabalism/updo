# How are we going to generate stack.yaml and stack.yaml.lock files?
#
# Choices are:
#  - dhall2stack = via a temporary ghc-x.y.z.dhall2stack.yaml
#  - dhall2yaml2stack = via a temporary ghc-x.y.z.dhall2yaml2stack.yaml
STACK_VIA := dhall2stack

# How are we going to generate the cabal.project file?
#
# Choices are:
#  - dhall2config = via a temporary ghc-x.y.z.dhall2config.project
#  - dhall2cabal = via a temporary ghc-x.y.z.dhall2cabal.project
#
# dhall2config is good when upgrading to a new GHC version. The
# <pkg-group>.config files will show how many in a group are yet to be upgraded.
# With the cabal imports it is possible to try things out quickly by editing the
# config files themselves if you want to momentarily sidestep Updo's make cabal
# project generation.
#
# dhall2cabal is good if you want the cabal project to closely match the layout
# of the stack project when that is generated using dhall2stack.

# dhall2cabal is also good if you need to use cabal < 3.8 where everything needs
# to be in one file. To achieve this, the
# project-dhall/project-dhall2cabal.dhall template will need to bring in the
# contents of the stackage import like this:
#
# ${../../project-stackage/$(STACKAGE_VERSION).config as Text}
CABAL_VIA := dhall2config

# Updo Dhall gives us these targets:
#  - project-files-dhall2stack
#  - project-files-dhall2cabal
#  - project-files-dhall2config
#  - project-sha256maps
include updo/project-dhall/Makefile
include updo/project-dhall2config/Makefile
include updo/project-nix/Makefile

# Project files used inproduction, not in GHC upgrade.
#
# By waiting for targets to the left of .WAIT, we ensure that what cabal
# downloads is not read before it is completely written.
